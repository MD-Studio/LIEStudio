# LIEStudio components

Most of the functionality of the LIEStudio application is arranged as a
number of independant Python modules that are installed in the LIEStudio
virtual environment at installation.

The ~/LIEStudio/components directory contains the Python packages for 
these modules that are installed using pip by the LIEStudio installer
script. Any package dependencies will be resolved automatically.
